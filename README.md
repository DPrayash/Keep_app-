# Keep_app-
This is a basic angular project including components and services also json database. Main project is a clone of google keep app.

This contains a one component that is header.component generated using the angular cmd, it has one service generated using service cmd, it contains a model.ts file containing the details of the list that is to be updated in the database
and contains a db.json which is generated by using json cmd. 
I have used angular ui to generate the ui of the app and cards that are being added and also added a delete button to delete the   data from the server as well as display.

If anyone wants to make changes fork it and raise a request so that this basic app can be made more advanced.
